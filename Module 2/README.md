# Introduction to CSS3
Creating a single responsive page that follows the mockup illustrations shown below.  
- You are not allowed to use any CSS or JavaScript framework, including Twitter Bootstrap, for this assignment.
- Desktop view (992px and above): each of the 3 sections should take up equal amount of space on the screen.
- Tablet view (between 768px and 991px, inclusively): the first 2 sections should be in the first row and be of equal size.
- Mobile view (equal to or less than 767px): each section should take up the entire row.
- Make sure the dummy text is "pushed down" enough so it doesn't overlap the section title region.
- Each section should have a background color of your choosing.
- Set a black border on both the section and section title region that is 1px thick.
- Optional: Consider explicitly setting a font-family for the text on your page to avoid using the default browser font.
- Optional: Set the font size of the heading and section title to be 75% and 25% larger, respectively, than the dummy text.
