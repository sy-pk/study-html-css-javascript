# Module 3
Creating the implementation of a single, responsive page that follows the provided mockup illustrations for desktop and tablet, mobile, and mobile with a dropdown menu.  
- Use Twitter Bootstrap CSS Framework as much as possible.
- Create a navbar that scrolls away with the page, becoming invisible and not fixed to the top when you scroll down.
- For desktop and tablet view, the navbar should not contain any other visible buttons.
- Create a simple menu button with three horizontal bars that displays a dropdown menu when clicked on mobile view.
- Center the "Our Menu" page heading within the browser window using a Bootstrap class.
## Required 
- Create a single, really tall section using the Bootstrap Grid that takes up the entire width of the browser window, with some margins, for desktop, tablet, and mobile views.

## Optional [Completed Assignment](https://cailynp.github.io/HTML-CSS-and-Javascript/Module%203/) f
- Provide a "Back to Top" link at the end of each section that jumps the page back to the "Our Menu" heading.
- In the desktop view, each of the 3 sections should take up equal amount of space on the screen. (use col-md-4)
- In the tablet view, place the first two sections in the first row with equal size and the third section in the second row taking up the entire row. (use col-sm-12)
- In the mobile view, each section should take up the entire row. (use col-xs-12)
- As you make the browser window wider or narrower, each section should become wider or narrower.
- Link the menu items "Chicken", "Beef", "Sushi" from the mobile-only menu drop down to jump to the part of the page those sections correspond to.
