# Coding the Static Restaurant Site
Creating the implementation of a single, responsive page that follows the provided mockup illustrations for desktop and tablet, mobile, and mobile with a dropdown menu.  
- Use Twitter Bootstrap CSS Framework as much as possible.
- Create a navbar that scrolls away with the page, becoming invisible and not fixed to the top when you scroll down.
- The navbar should have a company name (`navbar-brand` class) called "Food, LLC" that is aligned to the left side of the navbar.
- For desktop and tablet view, the navbar should not contain any other visible buttons.
- Create a simple menu button with three horizontal bars that displays a dropdown menu when clicked on mobile view.
- Center the "Our Menu" page heading within the browser window using a Bootstrap class.
- Desktop, tablet, and mobile mockup illustrations should correspond to Bootstrap's `md`, `sm`, and `xs` classes, respectively.
  
## Required 
- Create a single, really tall section using the Bootstrap Grid that takes up the entire width of the browser window, with some margins, for desktop, tablet, and mobile views.

## Optional [Completed Assignment](https://sy-pk.github.io/study-html-css-javascript/Module%203/) 
- Provide a "Back to Top" link at the end of each section that jumps the page back to the "Our Menu" heading.
- In the desktop view, each of the 3 sections should take up equal amount of space on the screen. (use `col-md-4`)
- In the tablet view, place the first two sections in the first row with equal size and the third section in the second row taking up the entire row. (use `col-sm-12`)
- In the mobile view, each section should take up the entire row. (use `col-xs-12`)
- As you make the browser window wider or narrower, each section should become wider or narrower.
- Link the menu items "Chicken", "Beef", "Sushi" from the mobile-only menu drop down to jump to the part of the page those sections correspond to.
