# Using Javascript to Build Web Applications  
Enhancing the functionality of our restaurant web application by introducing a fun twist to the Specials menu category.  
Previously, when users clicked on the "Specials" tile on the home page, they were directed to a fixed menu category called "Specials."  
Now, this assignment changes that behavior by redirecting users to a random category page each time they click on the "Specials" tile, whether itâ€™s Lunch, Dinner, Sushi, or any other category.  

In order to accomplish this, we need to change the home HTML snippet and, besides pulling it dynamically from the server, also insert a random category `short_name` into the function call of the following code.  
Previously, the code to send the user to the "Specials" category was this:

```html
<a href="#" onclick="$dc.loadMenuItems('SP');">
```

For this assignment, we changed this line to prepare it for a random category `short_name` to be this:

```html
<a href="#" onclick="$dc.loadMenuItems({{randomCategoryShortName}});">
```
You are NOT allowed to change the `home-snippet.html` file.   
Any adjustments to the value of `randomCategoryShortName` property needs to be done in `js/script.js` file.
